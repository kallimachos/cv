Community
=========

I have always enjoyed community involvement. At university, I volunteered in a
variety of roles for organizations I was involved with. For example, I
captained both my soccer and rowing teams and served on the graduate committee
as a social secretary.

While I still volunteer with my cycling club, my focus in recent years has
shifted mainly to the IT world.
