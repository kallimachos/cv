The OpenShift Enterprise Administration Guide, written for Red Hat, is a recent
example of my technical writing. This document won a Society for Technical
Communication Merit Award.

The Git Guide is a lighter document originally written in Docbook XML. I
developed it to help my colleagues work with Git version control, then open
sourced it on GitHub in Markdown format after a request from a technical writer
at Rackspace.

Prior to my technical writing career, I studied ancient Greek and Latin
literature. My doctoral dissertation was a close examination of the literary
aspects of Nicander’s Theriaca, a Hellenistic Greek poem on venomous animals
and medicinal cures. My chapter on Nicander’s Didactic Techniques provides a
sense of my work in the academic genre.

In addition to these more serious works, I share a blog with my wife about our
lives in Australia called Mythos, and between travelogs and cycling events I
share my thoughts on technology. For example, I wrote a Head First Python
Review that prompted the publisher to contact me for further feedback. I have
also guest blogged about Agile methodology for the Society of Technical
Communication, Australia Chapter.

To automate aspects of my workflow, I have written several scripts in Python
and Bash. These useful bits of code, along with some less useful bits from my
learning days, can be found in my GitHub repository.
