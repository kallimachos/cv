Originally from Canada, I now live in Brisbane, Australia, where I work as an
Information Architect at Rackspace. I divide my time between documenting
Rackspace Private Cloud and upstream OpenStack.

Previously, I was a Technical Writer at Red Hat, where I started as part of a
small team dedicated to their new Platform-as-a-Service offering, `OpenShift
<https://www.openshift.com/>`_. After successfully contributing to the
documentation for this software from its beta beginnings until it became a paid
product, I then took the opportunity to lead my own team of writers on `Red Hat
CloudForms <https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/cloudforms>`_.
CloudForms is a cloud management platform that integrates with a range of cloud
technologies such as OpenStack, Amazon EC2, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization,
and VMware vSphere; writing for CloudForms required sound knowledge of all
these products and regular cross-team collaboration.

Learning about new technology and sharing that knowledge with others is the
highlight of my job, so it is no surprise that I am involved in several
community efforts. I am an OpenStack Active Technical Contributor, and I’ve run
several workshops on open source software for school-age girls. More details of
my community activities can be found on the :ref:`community` page.

When I’m not learning or writing, I spend my time cycling, reading, and
grooming my beard.
