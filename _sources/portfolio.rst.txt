`Sphinxmark <https://kallimachos.github.io/sphinxmark/>`_ is a Sphinx extension
I wrote and documented for the OpenStack Documentation project that enables
watermarks. It was later adopted by other OpenStack projects.

`Chios <https://kallimachos.github.io/chios/>`_ is a collection of Sphinx
extensions that adds useful roles and directives.

The :download:`OpenShift Enterprise Administration Guide
<_static/Administration_Guide.pdf>`, written for Red Hat, is a longer example
of my technical writing. This document won a Society for Technical
Communication Merit Award.

The `Git Guide <http://kallimachos.github.io/docs/git-guide/index.html>`_ is a
shorter document originally written in Docbook XML. I developed it to help my
Red Hat colleagues work with Git version control, then open sourced it on
GitHub in reStructuredText format after a request from a technical writer at
Rackspace. The guide is in a public `Documentation repository
<http://kallimachos.github.io/docs/index.html>`_ that houses other bits of my
writing about a variety of subjects.

In addition to these technical works, I share a blog with my wife about our
lives in Australia called `Mythos <http://aetia-mythos.rhcloud.com/>`_, and
between travelogs and cycling events I share my thoughts on technology. For
example, I wrote a `Head First Python Review
<http://aetia-mythos.rhcloud.com/head-first-python-review/>`_ that prompted the
publisher to contact me for further feedback.

Other writing and code examples can be found in my `GitHub repositories
<https://github.com/kallimachos>`_, with that caveat that many of those are
unfinished personal projects.
